## Who is KatQwer
Heya! Welcome to my GitHub account! I go by Kat, I'm an 18 year old current Applied Computer Science student and I'm just here to show off all my personal project! I go by any pronouns, so just use whichever one makes you feel more comfortable! ^^
## My studies
I'm currently studying at Thomas More Campus of Applied Sciences for my bachelor's in Applied Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence. Ever since I was younger, I've been interested in PCs and technology. Being able to study AI and being part of a modern tech revolution is a really big motivator for me to study as much as I can right now!
## What am I currently learning
Just being done with my first year, I learned how to work with Linux and share data between 2 operating systems, how to work properly as a Full-Stack developer, the security and risks that are involved in Computer Science, using Docker and working with the Cloud & DevOps pipeline, the basics of Java and how to set up my own virtual network in Cisco Packet Tracer! In my own time, I'm currently learning more about web development. Specifically, I'm learning how to use React for a more modern way to make websites.
## Potential collaboration
I'm open to working on any coding project you're willing to let me help on! Even if it's not in my expertise, I'm always down to learn more about coding in whatever way is required!
